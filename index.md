# Welcome!

[HEROES Academy](http://heroesgifted.org) is an organization dedicated to enrichment the minds of advanced students.  

This Github page is intended to organize the Computer Science club.  
For now, the club is in its infancy.  
So, this page is just going to link to the current courses, for now.

### Current courses with content on github:
1. [Intro to AI: Agents and Games](http://ai-winter-2016.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
2. [Data Structures](http://datastructures-winter-2016.readthedocs.org/)
3. [Introduction to Python](http://intropython-winter-2016.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
